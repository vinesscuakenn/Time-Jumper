# Time Jumper

A unique game built with Python and Pygame where you control a character that can jump back in time to avoid obstacles and collect time orbs to extend your survival time. Survive as long as possible by collecting orbs and dodging barriers!

## Installation

2. Install Pygame by running `pip install pygame` in your terminal.

## How to Play

1. Run the `time_jumper.py` file using Python.
2. Use the **Up** and **Down Arrow Keys** to move the character (white square) vertically.
3. Press the **Spacebar** to jump back in time to your position 2 seconds ago (5-second cooldown).
4. Collect yellow time orbs to increase your score and add 2 seconds to the game timer.
5. Avoid blue obstacles moving from the right side of the screen.
6. The game ends when you hit an obstacle or run out of time.
7. Your score is based on the number of orbs collected.
